                Hi there! My name is Dan Susman. Pleasure. This is my website.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a recent graduate from

                    >Northeastern University</a
                >, where I earned my BS in Computer Science. I'm a sponge for
                new thoughts, advocate for collaboration, and proponent of
                discipline and hard work. I believe in clear, concise
                documentation and rich learning materials for newly built
                libraries, languages, and tools.
            </p>

                I'm currently working at

                Though this means I spend a lot of time working in Swift and
                Objective-C, I'm also big into programming languages, compilers,
                dev tools, and privacy. I've been playing around with

                out what I've been up to on my GitHub. Since I think learning in

            <p>
                I'm currently a Software Developer at Ginger Labs, doing all
                things iOS, macOS, iPadOS. More details to come, I'm sure.
            </p>
            <p>
                I spent six months working at Ginger Labs as an iOS Engineering
                Co-op in 2022. While there, I fell in love with the small team,
                big impact style of work. I worked on large scale state
                refactors, squashed a ton of bugs, and took on other secret,
                miscellaneous projects/tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Previously, I was a Software Engineering Co-op at Corindus
                Vascular Robotics, a Siemens Healthineers Company. There, I
                worked on a state of the art medical robotic devices R&D team. I
                focused on application and cloud development, integration
                testing, and embedded software. I also spent some time doing
                hardware stuff, building robots, no big deal.
