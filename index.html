      <h2>about</h2>
      <p>Hi there! My name is Dan Susman. Pleasure. This is my website.</p>
      <p>
        I am a fourth year computer science student at
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          href="https://northeastern.edu"
          >Northeastern University</a
        >. I'm a sponge for new thoughts, advocate for collaboration, and
        proponent of discipline and hard work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though I'm curently working with Apple systems, heavily using Swift and
        Objective-C, I'm also big into concurrency and privacy. I'm getting more
        and more into open-source contribution, Go, and developer
        experience/advocacy. I dream of learning Rust, and leading teams of
        engineers to greatness. Those aren't necessarily connected.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're interested in working or chatting with me, I'd love for you to
        reach out!
      </p>

      <p>
        I am currently an iOS Developer at Ginger Labs, working on
        <a

          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          href="https://notability.com"
          >Notability</a
        >. I spent six months working there as an iOS Engineering Co-op in 2022,
        and fell in love with the small team, big impact style of work. I worked
        on large scale state refactors, building the Notability Widgets, adding
        support for Siri Shortcuts, bug squashing, and other miscellaneous
        projects/tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, I was a Software Engineering Co-op at Corindus Vascular
        Robotics, a Siemens Healthineers Company. There, I worked on a state of
        the art medical robotic devices R&D team. I focused on application and
        cloud development, integration testing, and embedded software. I also
        spent some time doing hardware stuff, building robots, no big deal.
